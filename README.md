# CMPSC 297 Project 1: A Portfolio in React

_Due: February 23, 2023_

For this project, you will have zero starter code. Your goal is to remake a
portfolio in React.JS, similar to the one from Homework 3.

The page must have:

-   Your name;
-   Three projects, consisting of:
    -   A project title;
    -   A project description;
    -   What programming language(s)/tools you used.
-   A link to your GitHub.
-   Some Utilization of State

While it is not required to style your portfolio via CSS, we strongly recommend
it.

Alongside this you will also submit a paper detailing your design ideas.

The paper must have:

-   A breakdown of the DOM Tree
-   An explanation of your state design process for wherever you implemented
    state

## What you'll be graded on

You'll be graded on having the JavaScript files as instructed, as well as the
correctness of JavaScript files. If you have all of the information listed
above, you will get full credit.

The code is worth 70 points and the paper is worth 30 points. The code point
breakdown is

-   30 pts: Successful Implementation of State
-   20 pts: the three projects displayed on the page
-   20 pts: The entire page displays successfully with name and link included

The point breakdown for the paper is

-   20 pts: Explaining how your React States work, including describing the
    possible states, why it needs to be rerendered, and an explanation of the
    trigger
-   10 pts: a Document Object Model Tree Diagram of your React App as well as
    reasoning behind the structure (why one component is a child to another
    etc.)

This project is intentionally open-ended for you to be able to do what you want.
Add whatever you may like on top of this to make your own portfolio. Be 
creative!
